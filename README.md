This is a little project i made to start learning how react workd and how to make a full stack application. 
It takes in only pptx files, processes the powerpoints, then gives back a nice pdf of a summary. 
Currently the hosting is being done for as cheap as possible along with only using gpt 3.5turbo, but
there are plans to do more in the future soon!
